# wildwalk

## Pokemon Go, but with real-life species!

## To-do List:

- store collected species somewhere... I'll try to use MongoDB Atlas
- Get user coordinates
  - get current country/state from the coordinates- react-geocode? geonames?
- Can integrate google lens to automatically identify the photo of the species
- React-image to show loader while photos load in cards
- Somehow get photos of each species on its card
- remove species from dashboard that are in collection
