# wildwalk

## Pokemon Go, but with real-life species! Made for BackyardHacks.

## What it does

- See native species in your state.... but its currently hardcoded to NJ
- Add photos to your collection.... but MongoDB isn't working on my ec2 instance for some reason
- Check out past photos added to your collection.... but same thing as above

## To-do List:

- Get user coordinates
  - get current country/state from the coordinates- react-geocode? geonames?
- Can integrate google lens to automatically identify the photo of the species
- React-image to show loader while photos load in cards
- Somehow get photos of each species on its card
- remove species from dashboard that are in collection
